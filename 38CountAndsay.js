/**
 * Let's perform a detailed dry run of the `countAndSay` function for `n = 4`, focusing on how recursion and iteration work together.

### Recursion Tree and Call Flow

1. **Initial Call: `countAndSay(4)`**
   - Since `n` is not 1, it calls `countAndSay(3)`.

2. **Recursive Call: `countAndSay(3)`**
   - Since `n` is not 1, it calls `countAndSay(2)`.

3. **Recursive Call: `countAndSay(2)`**
   - Since `n` is not 1, it calls `countAndSay(1)`.

4. **Base Case: `countAndSay(1)`**
   - Since `n` is 1, it returns the string "1".

### Building the Sequence Back Up

#### **Returning to `countAndSay(2)`**
- The `countAndSay(1)` function returns "1".
- Now, `prev = "1"` in `countAndSay(2)`.
- Initialize `result = ""` and `count = 1`.

##### Iteration in `countAndSay(2)`:
- Loop through `prev = "1"`:
  - For `i = 0`:
    - There is no next character to compare with, so add `count.toString() + prev[i]` to `result`.
    - `result += "11"`.

- `countAndSay(2)` returns "11".

#### **Returning to `countAndSay(3)`**
- The `countAndSay(2)` function returns "11".
- Now, `prev = "11"` in `countAndSay(3)`.
- Initialize `result = ""` and `count = 1`.

##### Iteration in `countAndSay(3)`:
- Loop through `prev = "11"`:
  - For `i = 0`:
    - Compare `prev[0]` and `prev[1]` (both are '1'):
      - Since they are the same, increment `count` to 2.
  - For `i = 1`:
    - There is no next character to compare with, so add `count.toString() + prev[i]` to `result`.
    - `result += "21"`.

- `countAndSay(3)` returns "21".

#### **Returning to `countAndSay(4)`**
- The `countAndSay(3)` function returns "21".
- Now, `prev = "21"` in `countAndSay(4)`.
- Initialize `result = ""` and `count = 1`.

##### Iteration in `countAndSay(4)`:
- Loop through `prev = "21"`:
  - For `i = 0`:
    - Compare `prev[0]` and `prev[1]` ('2' and '1'):
      - Since they are different, add `count.toString() + prev[i]` to `result`.
      - `result += "12"`.
      - Reset `count` to 1.
  - For `i = 1`:
    - There is no next character to compare with, so add `count.toString() + prev[i]` to `result`.
    - `result += "11"`.

- `countAndSay(4)` returns "1211".

### Explanation of the Iterative Process

- At each step, the function makes a recursive call to `countAndSay(n-1)` until it reaches the base case (`n = 1`), which returns "1".
- As the recursion unwinds, each function call processes the string returned by the previous call (`prev`) to construct the current term.
- The `for` loop in each function iterates over the characters in `prev`, counting consecutive characters and appending the count and the character to `result`.
- The value of `prev` in each call is the result of the previous recursive call, and it is processed only within its respective `for` loop.

### Final Result

The final result for `n = 4` is "1211", as constructed by `countAndSay(4)` through recursive calls and iterative processing.

/**
### Dry Run for `n = 4`

#### Initial State
- `current = "1"`

#### Iteration 1 (`i = 2`)

1. `next = ""`, `count = 1`
2. Loop through `current = "1"`:
   - For `j = 0`:
     - `current[0]` is '1'
     - There is no `current[1]` to compare with.
     - Append `count.toString() + current[j]` to `next`:
       - `next = "11"`
     - Reset `count` to 1.
3. Update `current` to `next`:
   - `current = "11"`

#### Iteration 2 (`i = 3`)

1. `next = ""`, `count = 1`
2. Loop through `current = "11"`:
   - For `j = 0`:
     - `current[0]` is '1'
     - `current[1]` is also '1'
     - Since they are the same, increment `count` to 2.
   - For `j = 1`:
     - There is no `current[2]` to compare with.
     - Append `count.toString() + current[j]` to `next`:
       - `next = "21"`
     - Reset `count` to 1.
3. Update `current` to `next`:
   - `current = "21"`

#### Iteration 3 (`i = 4`)

1. `next = ""`, `count = 1`
2. Loop through `current = "21"`:
   - For `j = 0`:
     - `current[0]` is '2'
     - `current[1]` is '1'
     - Since they are different, append `count.toString() + current[j]` to `next`:
       - `next = "12"`
     - Reset `count` to 1.
   - For `j = 1`:
     - `current[1]` is '1'
     - There is no `current[2]` to compare with.
     - Append `count.toString() + current[j]` to `next`:
       - `next = "1211"`
     - Reset `count` to 1.
3. Update `current` to `next`:
   - `current = "1211"`

### Final Output
- After completing the iterations, the final value of `current` is `"1211"`, which is the 4th term in the "Count and Say" sequence.

### Summary
- **Iteration 1 (`i = 2`)**: `current = "1"` → `next = "11"` → `current = "11"`
- **Iteration 2 (`i = 3`)**: `current = "11"` → `next = "21"` → `current = "21"`
- **Iteration 3 (`i = 4`)**: `current = "21"` → `next = "1211"` → `current = "1211"`

The iterative approach successfully constructs the sequence step by step, with the final result for `n = 4` being `"1211"`.
